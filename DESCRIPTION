Description: This package demonstrates an extension of ggplot2 that builds on the
    empirical distribution function to create alternative plots to the step-function
    plot. One of these allows the user to create percentile summary graphs. 
    These graphs show a scatterplot of points ({\frac{i}{n}},{X_i}) given a vector y, 
    as well as horizantel quantile lines. The package also allows the user to create 
    cumulative percentage polygon graphs, which connect points ({X_i}, {\frac{i}{n}}) 
    and show how each percentage is added as the graph progresses.
